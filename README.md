# Dotfiles

## Usage

To install my dotfiles, use dotbot with the `./install`.
The dotbot repository will automatically be cloned if not present.
By default, it won't remove config files that are not symlink to prevent overriding of existing config.

## Currently

- i3
- zsh
- conky
- Xressources and xinit
- Folder architecture
